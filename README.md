# NMLUpdater
A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to Automaticly Update Installed Mods<br>


## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [NMLUpdater.dll](https://github.com/AlexW-578/NMLUpdater/releases/latest/download/NMLUpdater.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Download the updater executable for your OS from [NML-Updater-App](https://github.com/AlexW-578/NML-Updater-App) or Create your own.
4. Place the executable into a folder called ``nml_updater`` in the root of your neos install.
5. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

## Options:
- Enabled - Enables and disables the whole mod
- AutoSpawnList - Automaticly spawns a list in userspace when loading into the game
- ModlistToFile - Creates a JSON file with all the mods that need updating
- SpawnProgram - Launches the Updater Program whenever Neos closes
